  "Developing a mobile game in just two weeks at a summer IT school turned out to be a significant project. The playerâ€™s task is to scan a product by rotating it with their fingers so that the scan code appears in the center of the screen. The game was published in Play Market, however it is not available for download now. The game was developed in a team of 4 people, where I was responsible for the development of the game logic and the user interface. The game was developed in Unity and C#.",
  "TRIK Studio is an integrated development environment designed using QtCreator for children to learn robot programming that features a simulation run that utilizes a 2D virtual robot model. The purpose of the work was to improve the quality of visualization and make it three-dimensional. The problem was solved on Unity engine. The demo video shows the work of the simulated environment, where the robot moves along a given path and performs a task. The robot is controlled by a program written in the TRIK Studio IDE and the running program sincronizes with Unity project where the environment is simulated.",
